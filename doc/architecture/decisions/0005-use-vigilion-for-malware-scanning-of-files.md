# 5. Use Vigilion for Malware Scanning of Files

Date: 2016-06-01

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The service needs to scan files for malware before they are accessible to users.

## Decision

We will use the Vigilion service to scan files for malware before they are accessible to users of the service. The service has prebuilt open-source libraries for Ruby on Rails.

## Consequences

By using an existing service, we will save time implementing malware scanning. The service will be run within the GOV.UK PaaS.
