# 2. Use Ruby on Rails as the Application Framework

Date: 2014-11-17

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We are rebuilding an exisiting legacy system to that it meets the GOV.UK Service Standard. We are also using the GOV.UK Design System.

## Decision

We have decided to use Ruby on Rails as the development framework for our service. We will leverage existing code and libraries from GOV.UK. Ruby on Rails is a mature framework with an active community and is open source, making it a suitable choice for our needs.

## Consequences

By choosing a widely adopted framework like Ruby on Rails, the team can concentrate on delivering features at a rapid pace. This eliminates the need to spend excessive time on architectural or design decisions.
