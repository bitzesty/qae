# Unlocking A User

Occasionally a user will lock themselves out of their account due to multiple failed login attempts with the incorrect email or password. Once a lock is applied, the user cannot login, nor can a KAE admin view/edit the associated KAE applications. Happily, it's simple enough for a member of the KAE team to remove the lock from the user's account:

1. Login to the KAE admin dashboard.
2. Click into the "Users" tab and search for the user's email address.
3. Click into the user's profile from the search results table.
4. Scroll to the bottom of the form and press the "Unlock user" button.
