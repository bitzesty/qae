## ![Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitzesty/qae/master/public/logo.jpg) King's Awards for Enterprise

"QAE" is the application which powers the application process for The King's Awards for Enterprise.

# Setup

## Pre-requisites

- Ruby 3.2.2
- `gem install bundler -v 2.5.6`
- Rails 7.0.5
- Postgresql 9.5+
- Redis 2.8
- Cloudfountry Client

### Running application

```
./bin/setup
bundle exec rails s
bundle exec sidekiq -C config/sidekiq.yml
```

If you're running this on your local dev setup, start redis first before starting sidekiq

### Running with docker

    $ cp Dockerfile.local Dockerfile
    $ cp docker-compose.yml.local docker-compose.yml
    $ docker-compose up

#### Help

If you see the following error:

```
ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid: PG::UndefinedFile: ERROR:  could not open extension control file "/usr/share/postgresql/9.3/extension/hstore.control": No such file or directory
: CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "hstore"
```

This means, that `hstore postgresql` extension needs to be installed:

```
sudo apt-get install postgresql-contrib
```

### Install Poxa

If you need to test collaborators editing the application at the same time, install poxa.

# Deploying

Continuous Deployment is setup and the application will automatically deploy after passing CI on the target branch (main, staging, production). For more details see the Github Actions.
