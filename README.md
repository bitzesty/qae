# ![Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitzesty/qae/master/public/logo.jpg) King's Awards for Enterprise

"QAE" is the application which powers the application process for The King's Awards for Enterprise.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Ruby 3.2.2
  - `gem install bundler -v 2.5.6`
- Node.js
- Rails 7.0
- Postgresql 9.5+ with `hstore` extension
- Redis 4+

### Running the application

There are environment variables that you may want to modify in the `.env` file.

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Ensure the postgres database and redis server are running.

```
./bin/setup
```

Run the application with the following commands:

```
bundle exec rails s
bundle exec sidekiq -C config/sidekiq.yml
```

or with foreman:

```
foreman start
```

### Running with docker

    $ cp Dockerfile.local Dockerfile
    $ cp docker-compose.yml.local docker-compose.yml
    $ docker-compose up

### Installing Poxa

If you need to test collaborators editing the application at the same time, install [poxa](https://github.com/bitzesty/poxa).

### Installing Malware Scanning

Files are uploaded to S3 and then scanned with ClamAV via the Vigilion service.

If you need to test malware scanning locally, install [Vigilion](https://github.com/bitzesty/vigilion-scanner) and set the `VIGILION_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `VIGILION_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `DISABLE_VIRUS_SCANNER` to `false` in the `.env` file.

### Running the tests

    $ bundle exec rspec

## Deploying

Continuous Deployment is setup and the application will automatically deploy after passing CI on the target branch (main, staging). Production deployment is a manually triggered action (production branch). For more details see the Github Actions.
