            <h3>About this section</h3>

            <p>This section enables you to present the details of how your organisation has made a difference by promoting opportunity through social mobility. This may have been as a core aim of your organisation or achieved via a social mobility initiative <strong>for at least two years</strong>. Your answers will provide us with evidence on how this benefits the participants, your organisation and wider society.</p>

            <h3>Social mobility definition</h3>

            <p>Social mobility is a measure of the ability to move from a lower socio-economic background to higher socio-economic status.</p>

              <li>Socio-economic status is a person's current social and economic circumstances.</li>
            </ul>
