              You may find it helpful to familiarise yourself with the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). While they include impacts at a national level, you may want to reference the real positive impact your organisation contributes towards them.

              You do not need to show impact in each of these areas, only the ones that are most applicable to your sustainable development interventions.
