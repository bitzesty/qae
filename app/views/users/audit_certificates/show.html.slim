            li If relevant, in the External Accountant's Report, provide actual figures to replace estimates submitted at the time of the application or make any other changes to the figures. If you make any revisions, you have to sign the Applicant's Management's Statement section in the report.
            li Once you make the revisions (if any), the accountant may perform their own relevant procedures and will return the completed External Accountant's Report to the applicant.
