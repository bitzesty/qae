Dear <%= @recipient.full_name %>,

We are emailing to remind you that you have until

#<%= @deadline_time %> on <%= @deadline %>

to provide the latest financial statements & VAT returns and, if applicable, an explanation of the variance between the estimates and the actuals by following the link below:

<%= users_form_answer_figures_and_vat_returns_url(@form_answer) %>

#We cannot extend this deadline.

If you do not submit the required latest financial information before the deadline, we will not have sufficient information to assess your application, and it will be withdrawn.

#Below is a reminder of the steps you need to take:

  1.  Login into your King's Awards for Enterprise dashboard and follow the steps to upload any latest financial statements and VAT returns by following the “Provide the latest financial information” link.
     <%= users_form_answer_figures_and_vat_returns_url(@form_answer) %>
  2. Check how the estimated figures you provided in section C of your application form compare with the actuals. (If you do not have your filled-in application form handy, you can download it from the King's Award for Enterprise account dashboard).
  3. You will have to submit a separate variance explanation document if:
    a) any of the actual figures are worse by 10% or more. Please explain the reasons for the difference.
    b) the actuals include losses that you did not state on your application form. Please explain the reasons for the losses and how your business is financially viable.

Please note, following the sad death of HM Queen Elizabeth II, His Majesty will be consulted on the future of the Awards, but no immediate decisions will be made.

Yours sincerely,

Nichola Bruno
Head, The King’s Awards for Enterprise Office
