p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;"
  | 2. Check how the estimated figures you provided in section C of your application form compare with the actuals. (If you do not have your filled-in application form handy, you can download it from the King's Award for Enterprise account dashboard).

p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;"
  | 3. You will have to submit a separate variance explanation document if:
  br
  | a) any of the actual figures are worse by 10% or more. Please explain the reasons for the difference.
  br
  | b) the actuals include losses that you did not state on your application form. Please explain the reasons for the losses and how your business is financially viable.

p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;"
  | Please note, following the sad death of HM Queen Elizabeth II, His Majesty will be consulted on the future of the Awards, but no immediate decisions will be made.
