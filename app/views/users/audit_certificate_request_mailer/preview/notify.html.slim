p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;"
  | 1. Log in now to your Queen's Award account and download the External Accountant's Report form by following the link below:<br/>
  = link_to(users_form_answer_audit_certificate_url(@form_answer), users_form_answer_audit_certificate_url(@form_answer))

p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;"
  | 2. We recommend that you send the report to the accountant straight away so that you can agree on the timelines. Let them know if you will be providing revisions to the figures.

p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;"
  | 3. If relevant, in the External Accountant's Report, provide actual figures to replace estimates submitted at the time of the application or make any other changes to the figures. If you make any revisions, you have to sign the Applicant's Management's Statement section in the report.

p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;"
  | 4. Once you make the revisions (if any), the accountant may perform their own relevant procedures and will return the completed External Accountant's Report.

p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;"
  | 5. Log in and upload the External Accountant's Report to the Queen’s Award online portal, “Verification of figures” page, by following the link below:<br/>
  = link_to(users_form_answer_audit_certificate_url(@form_answer), users_form_answer_audit_certificate_url(@form_answer))
