<%= "Dear #{@recipient.full_name}," %>

We are emailing to remind you that you have until

#<%= @deadline_time %> on <%= @deadline %>

to provide verification of the commercial figures by submitting an External Accountant's Report by following the link below:
<%= users_form_answer_audit_certificate_url(@form_answer) %>

#We cannot extend this deadline.

If you do not submit your External Accountant's Report before the deadline, we will not have sufficient information to assess your application and it will be withdrawn.

#Below is a reminder of the steps you need to take:

  1. Log in now to your King's Award account and download the External Accountant's Report form by following the link below:
     <%= users_form_answer_audit_certificate_url(@form_answer) %>
  2. We recommend that you send the report to the accountant straight away so that you can agree on the timelines. Let them know if you will be providing revisions to the figures.
  3. If relevant, in the External Accountant's Report, provide actual figures to replace estimates submitted at the time of the application or make any other changes to the figures. If you make any revisions, you have to sign the Applicant's Management's Statement section in the report.
  4. Once you make the revisions (if any), the accountant may perform their own relevant procedures and will return the completed External Accountant's Report to the applicant.
  5. Log in and upload the External Accountant's Report to the King’s Award online portal, “Verification of figures” page, by following the link below:
     <%= users_form_answer_audit_certificate_url(@form_answer) %>

Yours sincerely,

Nichola Bruno
Head of The King’s Awards Office
