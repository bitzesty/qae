#We cannot extend this deadline.

If you do not submit your External Accountant's Report and the accompanying List of Procedures document before the deadline, we will not have sufficient information to assess your application and it will be withdrawn.

#Below is a reminder of the steps you need to take:

  1. Log in now to your Queen's Award account and download the External Accountant's Report form by following the link below:
     <%= users_form_answer_audit_certificate_url(@form_answer) %>
  2. Send the report to the accountant to agree on the timelines and let them know if you will be providing revisions to the figures.
  3. If relevant, make any revisions to the figures in the report. If you make revisions, you have to sign the Applicant's Management's Statement section in the report.
  4. Once you make the revisions (if any), the accountant will perform relevant procedures and will return the completed External Accountant's Report as well as the supplementary list of procedures document to you.
  5. Login and upload the External Accountant's Report as well as the supplementary list of procedures document to the Queen's Award online portal by following the link below:
