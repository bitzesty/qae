#Congratulations on winning a King's Award for Enterprise: <%= @award_category_title %> <%= @award_year %> [<%= @urn %>]

<%= "Dear #{@name}," %>

I am delighted to inform you that His Majesty The King has approved the Prime Minister's recommendation that your company should receive a King's Award for Enterprise in the <%= @award_category_title %> category this year.

The Award is the most prestigious for UK businesses and this is a tremendous achievement. Your business now joins over 7,000 UK enterprises which have received this Royal recognition since the Awards were established in 1965.

It has been an exceptionally hard few years for businesses and this achievement is testament to the resilience you and your staff have shown through these unprecedented times.
