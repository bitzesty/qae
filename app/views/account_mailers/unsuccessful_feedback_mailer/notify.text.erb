#The King's Awards for Enterprise <%= @year %> [<%= @form_answer.urn %>]

Dear <%= @name %>,

Thank you for your entry to The Queen's Awards for Enterprise, which are now known as The King's Awards for Enterprise (see Annex A at the end of this email for further details).

I am sorry to inform you that your organisation was not among those recommended to His Majesty The King for an Award this year.

I know that this news will be disappointing, but I hope that you will find the comprehensive feedback provided useful. It often takes more than one attempt to achieve an Award and previously unsuccessful applicants report that they have found the assessors' feedback useful and insightful.

If, when you submitted your application, you agreed to share your contact details with your local Lord-Lieutenant, they may be in touch with you to discuss your application and feedback. Even if you did not agree to share your contact details with your local Lord-Lieutenant, may I encourage you to contact them or discuss your feedback with another independent person as those who reflect and act upon the feedback, often achieve future success.

You can view your application feedback by logging in to your King's Awards for Enterprise account:

To help you identify the range of business support, advice and opportunities available, please find some useful contacts, both within government and externally at Annex B at the end of this email.

Thank you once again for taking the time to enter The King's Awards for Enterprise and may I wish you every success in the future.

Yours sincerely,

Nichola Bruno
The Secretary
The King's Awards for Enterprise Office
