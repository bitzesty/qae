#The King's Awards for Enterprise <%= @year %> [<%= @form_answer.urn %>]

Dear <%= @name %>,

Thank you for your application for a King's Award for Enterprise.

I am sorry to inform you that, on this occasion, your application was unsuccessful.

I do appreciate that this news will be disappointing and I hope you will find the comprehensive feedback helpful, which is provided on your application account online. It often takes more than one attempt to achieve an Award and previously unsuccessful applicants report that they have found the assessors' feedback insightful, helping them to submit a stronger future application. Please don't forget that applications open again soon on 6 May for the next round, if you choose to reapply.

If, when you submitted your application, you agreed to share your contact details with your local Lord-Lieutenant, they may be in touch with you to discuss your application and feedback. Even if you did not agree to share your contact details with your local Lord-Lieutenant, may I encourage you to contact them or discuss your feedback with another independent person, as those who reflect and act upon the feedback often achieve future success.

You can view your application feedback by logging in to your King's Awards for Enterprise account:

Also, please find attached in Annex A, information on a range of business support, advice and opportunities available, and some useful contacts, both within government and externally.

Thank you once again for taking the time to apply for The King's Awards for Enterprise and may I wish you every success in the future.

Yours sincerely,

Nichola Bruno
The Secretary
The King's Awards for Enterprise Office
