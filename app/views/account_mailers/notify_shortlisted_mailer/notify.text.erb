Dear <%= @user.decorate.full_name %>,

I would like to inform you that your application by <%= @company_name %> has been shortlisted for a King's Award for Enterprise: <%= @award_type_full_name %>.

To enable us to proceed with your entry, you are required to provide verification of the commercial figures you provided in your application from an external accountant (as stated in the application form).

#Please do so by <%= @deadline_time %> on <%= @deadline_date %>.

Please follow the steps below:

  1. Log in now to your King's Award account and download the External Accountant's Report form by following the link below:
     <%= users_form_answer_audit_certificate_url(@form_answer) %>
  2. We recommend that you send the report to the accountant straight away so that you can agree on the timelines. Let them know if you will be providing revisions to the figures.
  3. If relevant, in the External Accountant's Report, provide actual figures to replace estimates submitted at the time of the application or make any other changes to the figures. If you make any revisions, you have to sign the Applicant's Management's Statement section in the report.
  4. Once you make the revisions (if any), the accountant may perform their own relevant procedures and will return the completed External Accountant's Report to the applicant.
  5. Log in and upload the External Accountant's Report to the King’s Award online portal, “Verification of figures” page, by following the link below:
     <%= users_form_answer_audit_certificate_url(@form_answer) %>


Please note:

  1. The External Accountants Report must be submitted by <%= @deadline_time %> on <%= @deadline_date %>. We cannot extend this deadline.
  2. Failure to provide this return on time will mean we do not have sufficient information to complete the assessment of your application, and it will not be considered at the next stage.
  3. Please do not make any public announcement of your shortlisted status now or at any time in the future. The assessment process is ongoing, and reaching this stage is not a guarantee of success.


Furthermore, as stipulated in (Section F4 Confirmation of Entry) on the application, the King's Awards Office will undertake due diligence checks with a range of government departments, agencies and public bodies. If you require further information on this, please contact us.

Please note, following the sad death of HM Queen Elizabeth II, His Majesty will be consulted on the future of the Awards, but no immediate decisions will be made.

Yours sincerely,

Nichola Bruno
Head, The King's Awards for Enterprise Office
