                li Your information is only shared with those involved in the assessment process.
                li Try to take full advantage of the word limits. However, the quality of your answers is more important than their length.
                li Plan enough time to prepare your responses, allowing time for refinement to ensure high-calibre submission before the deadline. Previous applicants reported taking at least 20 hours to complete the form, and a very few said they needed up to 50 hours.
                li You may want to spread your application over several weeks to allow time for collecting external evidence.
                li All questions are mandatory unless specified otherwise, but if the question is not applicable to your organisation, you can state so, explaining why it is not applicable.
                li Question numbers in the online version of the form aren't always consecutive, as we show and hide different questions depending on your previous answers.
                li You can skip questions and return to them at a later date.
                li Your answers are automatically saved as you go.
