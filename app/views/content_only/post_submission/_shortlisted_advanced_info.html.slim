    ' Verification of Commercial Figures
  | -  Use the link against your Shortlisted entries below to download a template for the Verification of Commercial Figures that you should give to your selected independent, practising, qualified Accountant/Auditor <strong>for them to complete</strong>. It should confirm all the figures quoted in the ‘Commercial Performance’ section of your submitted entry and any amended figures agreed subsequently with The Queen’s Awards Office. The certificate should relate to the figures for all the earnings claimed in support of your entry and must explain any discrepancy in the figures provided.  We do not require a full statutory audit and company annual reports are not acceptable.
