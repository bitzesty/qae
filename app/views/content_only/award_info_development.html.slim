                li The majority of previous applicants reported taking around 20 hours to complete the form. However, others took up to 50 hours, so please take time to prepare your responses to ensure submission before the deadline.

                li Question numbers aren't always consecutive, as we show and hide different questions depending on your answers.
                li Your answers are saved automatically as you go.
