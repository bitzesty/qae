              li Try to take full advantage of the word limits. However, the quality of your answer is more important than its length.
              li All questions are mandatory unless stated otherwise.
              li It can take up to 50 man-hours to complete the entry form, so you aren't expected to complete it in one sitting.
              li You can skip questions and return to them later.
              li Question numbers aren't always consecutive, as we show and hide different questions depending on your answers.
              li Your answers are saved automatically as you go.
