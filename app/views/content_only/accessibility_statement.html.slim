      | This website is run by the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS). We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:
    ul.govuk-list.govuk-list--bullet
      li
        | change colours, contrast levels and fonts
      li
        | zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
      li
        | navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
      li
        | navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
      li
        | listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of NVDA and VoiceOver)
    p.govuk-body
      | We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

      | How accessible this website is
    p.govuk-body
      | We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible:
    p.govuk-body
      | For users applying to the King’s Awards for Enterprise:
    ul.govuk-list.govuk-list--bullet
      li
        | The third party library we are using for the WYSIWYG editor has a built-in word count that is small and might be hard for some users to see.
      li
        | If a user is on a browser that does not support Javascript, error messages such as “This field is required”, may not immediately display when submitting an incomplete form. Some of these error messages may appear only on the second attempt to submit the incomplete form.
    p.govuk-body
      | For admin or assessor users:
    ul.govuk-list.govuk-list--bullet
      li
        | Some elements may be  difficult to see, due to a lack of colour contrast
      li
        | Some pages have interactive elements nested within expandable sections, these elements may be difficult to access for users using screen readers because they will not be announced if the section is closed. For example:
        ul.govuk-list.govuk-list--bullet
          li
            | ‘Edit’ links on the settings page are nested within the ‘Deadlines’ section, and are only announced when the section is expanded, if the section is closed a user may not know it is on the page.
      li
        | There are pages where similar sections have similar names, for users navigating the page with screen readers these may be difficult to differentiate between. For example:
        ul.govuk-list.govuk-list--bullet
          li
            | The ‘Edit’ links on the settings page each edit a different date, but the context is not specified when announced by screen readers, they are all announced as ‘Edit’ rather than ‘Edit submission period deadline’.
          li
            | The date and time pickers each schedule a different email notification, but the email type is not specified when the input is announced by screen readers.
          li
            | The ‘Cancel’ and ‘Save’ button labels do not specify which form they are cancelling or saving.
          li
            | The ‘Download’ links on the downloads page do have labels specifying the award type but do not specify the report type. Screen readers will announce ‘Download Innovation’ rather than ‘Download Innovation Case Study’.
      li
        | Similarly, for these expandable sections, the keyboard navigation is suboptimal, as when expanding/collapsing, saving/cancelling, the user’s focus should be directed to a relevant element, which would help indicate if the action worked.
      li
        | When saving feedbacks, comments or submitting appraisals, there is no success or error message, only a visual change, so users using screen readers might find it difficult to navigate.
      li
        | Some pages do not begin with the top-most heading level, or skip some heading levels, meaning the structure of the page may not be clear when using a screen reader.
      li
        | Some tables are missing a header, which might make it difficult to understand the context when the table data is announced by screen readers.
      li
        | On browsers that do not support Javascript, the dropdown elements on the ‘View application’ page are missing associated labels that describe what the dropdown refers to.
      li
        | When uploading files there is no error message if the file fails to upload, so users do not know why the file failed to upload.

    p.govuk-body
      | For all use types, form validation error messages are generic for all fields.
