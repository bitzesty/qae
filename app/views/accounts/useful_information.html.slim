        li If you meet the eligibility criteria, you can start to fill in the online application form.
        li You can download a PDF version of the form which can be helpful for reference purposes. Please note that <strong>applications are only accepted via the online form.</strong>
        li You can skip some questions depending on previous answers: the PDF version does not have this automatic feature built in and might mean you spend time on questions you don't need to.
        li You do not need to fill in the application form in one go: the data you enter is saved and you can come back to it later.
        li The majority of previous applicants reported taking around 20 hours to fill in the form. Please make enough time to prepare your responses and to ensure submission before the deadline.

      p.govuk-body Please be aware due diligence checks inform the decision to confer an Award. So, before you apply, please consider any issues that may prevent your application from receiving routine clearance.  For example, this may be fines or penalties you have received or non-compliance with regulations. <strong>Please check with your accountant and legal representatives if there are any outstanding or recent issues, as The King's Awards Office are unable to perform due diligence again once it has been completed.</strong>

      p.govuk-body Some examples of issues that may prevent your organisation from receiving clearance for The King's Awards for Enterprise include the following:
      ul.govuk-list.govuk-list--bullet
        li a failure to pay staff the minimum wage;
        li an accident within the workplace, which has resulted in harm being caused to the environment or employees;
        li a failure to fully comply with administrative filing requirements as stipulated by any Government Department or Agency.
